===================================

The following shiny app provides the simpliest Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built in R. 

BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height. Further information might be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index). 

The application takes the user's input on weight in kilograms and height in meters and calculates BMI with the following equation: BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2.

The application can be accessed via the following link:
